# FGraph

FGraph: A proposed variation of Space Syntax's JGraph where the network is visualized in a force-directed layout instead of its justified form (tree hierachy from root node).

**Hypothesis of Centrality Measures:**

1) Betweeness - Spaces with greatest potential for Through Movements (Spine)
2) Closeness - Spaces that are Easiest to Reach (Physical Centres)
3) Degree - Local Connectivity (Hallways)
4) Eigenvector - Spaces which are connected to more other Important Spaces (Hierachy of Spaces)
